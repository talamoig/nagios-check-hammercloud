This nagios plugin checks the HammerCloud job efficiency for a specific CMS site.
The job is done by looking at the page: http://hammercloud.cern.ch/hc/app/cms/joberrors/
The script takes as mandatory argument the CMS site name (eg. T1_CH_CERN, T2_IT_Rome,...).
By default it checks on the last 24 hours but a different lenght can be specified from command line.
